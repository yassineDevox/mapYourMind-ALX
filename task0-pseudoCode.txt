1. Start
	2. get the number of inputs from the user : N
	3. get the values of the N inputs from the user 
	4. Declare and intialize a variable Sum by 0
	5. For LOOP:
		6. set the counter to 1
		7. Break when counter reaches N ( number of inputs )
		8. Set Sum to Sum + (input * input)
		9. Increment the counter by 1
	10. FIN LOOP
	11. print the Sum of input's squares 
12. End
